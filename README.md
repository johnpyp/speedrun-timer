# Speedrun Timer - Fabric

## Usage

1. Install minecraft 1.16.x with fabric

     however MultiMC or Twitch Launcher will work fine. Each has an interface to create such a launcher.
2. Download the latest version of `speedruntimer-X.X.X.jar` from the [releases tab](https://github.com/johnpyp/speedrun-timer/releases).
3. Load the jar file as a mod through your launcher, put the downloaded jar in the mods folder.
4. Play! No configuration yet.

```
git clone https://github.com/johnpyp/speedrun-timer
cd speedrun-timer
./gradlew build

# Mod jar is in build/libs/speedruntimer-X.X.X.jar
